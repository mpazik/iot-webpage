# About the game
Isles of Tales is the sandbox role play multi-player browser game in which economy and politic are important factors. 
You control and develop your character. Story of the game, economy, geo-politics are full driven by Players.

## Land
The kingdom has found a new lands and search for a daredevil who will dare to discover and settle them.
The lands look rich but they do not seem to be an easy place to live. You will have to satisfy your hunger, 
protect from cold, wild animals and greed of other.

#### Cooperation for survival
You can try alone but is easier when you cooperate. You can establish settlement.
A well prospering settlement can be transformed to a proper city and invite other people to join it.
Some locations are especial good for establish cities. They may have deposits of rare minerals, be easy to defend or be on a trade route.
Though many will desire such location so the cities have to be well managed and armed to resist other's temptation to capture it.  

## Kingdom
#### Market
As the kingdom has found the new lands, it has build a small market where you can buy and sell materials and items.
Because it's a long and dangerous way to the new land the markup is high.
It's wiser to trade with other settlers if you only can.

#### Taxes
The kingdom apply some taxes on a land that you and a city owns. In return it guarantee that no one will touch your things as long as there is no declared war.
It does not interrupt to the local geopolitics.

#### Battles
There are many enemies of the kingdom. It always needs fresh recruits for battles. It's a good way to train your military skills and earn additional gold.

## Cities and politics
Cities are important thing in the game. Their governor could split the land to smaller parcels and rent them.
Ruler can create new taxes and for gathered money build roads, fortifications, markets, public facilities, recruit an army, 
corrupt rulers of other cities or give it to people who support they as a ruler.

#### Alliances and wars
Cities can create alliances or declare war to other cities. The winner will choose the next ruler of the defeated city.  
The next ruler can decide what to do with citizens. So better chose the city that is able to defend.

## Economy
Each island is different and provide different materials. Some are rare other more common.
The situation in the kingdom is not always stabilized so prices on the kingdom's markets will vary.  
That will make some cities thrive and other bankrupt and cause new wars and alliances.

All goods are gathered and crafted by players. However gathering and crafting will be either fun or could be automated.
I don't want to waste people's time on doing boring, repetitive things.

## Story
The stories as other things are created by players. You can participate in main game plots.
Some may be written down and share to other.

Each action is persisted. The whole game could be replayed. 
You will be able to see story of:
- player - see how abilities and equipment changed over time, look at the number of slayed enemies, gained achievements etc.
- isle - who discover it, who and when discover treasures, take a walk on a isle in its past
- city - who established it, history of wars and alliances, take a walk on a city in its past
- item - who created it, who own it, e.g. in case of weapon, how many enemies it slayed
You can check what was your impact on the world. 
It does not matter what you currently have. It only matter what you did and you can always see it and show it to your friends.
